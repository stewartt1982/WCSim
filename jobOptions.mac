# Choose the physics list.  
# Physics lists are described in the Geant4 documentation at 
# http://geant4.cern.ch/support/proc_mod_catalog/physics_lists/physicsLists.shtml
# and

#
# The list of available physics lists is output during WCSim initialization.
# A "WCSim" physics list is provided in addition to the Gean4 lists for backwards-compatibility
# uncomment one line below to choose the physics list
#
#/WCSim/physics/list QGSP_BIC_HP #preferred for energies below 5 GeV
#/WCSim/physics/list LBE # preferred for low-background experiments.  
/WCSim/physics/list WCSim # included for backward-compatibility.  Requires jobOptions2.mac

# set at least one (both to be sure) to SKI_SKDETSIM if you want to use the old combined Digitization & Trigger classes
